# Detecting COVID-19 from X-ray Images using CNN Model

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images with high accuracy. The CNN model is trained on a diverse dataset consisting of COVID-19-positive cases, normal cases, and other pneumonia cases.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training and evaluation consists of X-ray images collected from various sources. It includes:

- COVID-19-positive cases: X-ray images of patients confirmed to have COVID-19.
- Normal cases: X-ray images of healthy individuals without any respiratory illnesses.
- Other pneumonia cases: X-ray images of patients with pneumonia caused by factors other than COVID-19.

## Model Architecture

The CNN model is designed to learn and extract features from X-ray images that are indicative of COVID-19 infection. It consists of multiple convolutional layers, followed by pooling layers and fully connected layers. The model is trained using a large number of labeled X-ray images to optimize its performance in accurately classifying COVID-19 cases.

## Training and Evaluation

During the training phase, the CNN model learns to differentiate between COVID-19-positive cases, normal cases, and other pneumonia cases. The model is trained using appropriate optimization algorithms and loss functions to minimize classification errors.

To evaluate the performance of the model, a separate set of X-ray images is used for testing. The accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score are computed to assess the model's ability to correctly identify COVID-19 cases. Additionally, other evaluation metrics such as sensitivity and specificity may be considered to provide a comprehensive analysis of the model's performance.

## Results and Impact

The CNN model achieves a high accuracy rate in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images, which can significantly contribute to early detection and diagnosis of the disease. By accurately identifying COVID-19 cases, healthcare professionals can make prompt and informed decisions regarding patient care and isolation protocols.

The continuous refinement and improvement of the CNN model further enhance its performance, increasing its potential impact in effectively managing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic. This project aims to support healthcare professionals in their efforts to combat the spread of the virus and improve patient outcomes through early preventive measures.

## Deployment

The trained CNN model can be deployed in a web application or integrated into existing healthcare systems. By providing a user-friendly interface for uploading X-ray images, the application enables quick and automated detection of COVID-19 cases. This can help healthcare providers streamline the diagnostic process and prioritize treatment for individuals at risk.

## Features

### CNN Model: The heart of the project is a pre-trained CNN model, trained on a diverse dataset of COVID-19-positive cases, normal cases, and other pneumonia cases. The model has achieved a high accuracy of 95% in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images.
### Streamlit Web Application: The model is deployed using Streamlit, a Python library for creating web applications. The Streamlit application allows users to easily upload their X-ray images and receive predictions from the CNN model in real-time.
### User-friendly Interface: The web application provides a user-friendly interface with a simple and intuitive design. Users can upload their X-ray images through the application, and the predictions, along with associated probabilities, are displayed instantly.

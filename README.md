# COVID19 Detection App
Covid19 Detection Streamlit App based on Deep Learning

In this project, I developed a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 from X-ray images. The objective was to create an efficient and accurate tool to assist medical professionals in diagnosing COVID-19 based on radiographic imaging.

Here are the key highlights of the project:

- Data Collection: I collected a diverse dataset of X-ray images, consisting of COVID-19 positive cases as well as non-COVID-19 cases like normal and other types of pneumonia. The dataset was carefully labeled and ensured to be representative of real-world scenarios.

- Data Preprocessing: I performed necessary preprocessing steps on the X-ray images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation. These steps prepared the data for training the CNN model effectively.

- Model Architecture: I designed a custom CNN architecture specifically tailored for COVID-19 detection. The model comprised multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. I experimented with different architectures and selected the one that yielded the best performance.

- Model Training: I split the dataset into training and validation sets and trained the CNN model using the training set. I utilized optimization algorithms like gradient descent to adjust the model's parameters and minimize the loss function. I fine-tuned the hyperparameters to optimize the model's accuracy using the validation set.

- Model Evaluation: I evaluated the trained CNN model using a separate test set that was not used during the training process. I measured key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance in detecting COVID-19 from X-ray images.

- Deployment and User Interface: I developed a user-friendly interface that allows users to upload their X-ray images for COVID-19 detection. The interface displays the prediction results, indicating whether the X-ray image indicates a COVID-19 positive or negative case, along with the associated probabilities. I deployed the system using web frameworks like Streamlit or Flask.

- Fine-tuning and Improvement: I continuously refined and improved the model based on user feedback and additional data. I fine-tuned the model architecture, experimented with different hyperparameters, and even considered transfer learning techniques to enhance the model's accuracy and generalization.

Overall, this project aimed to provide a valuable tool for healthcare professionals to quickly and accurately detect COVID-19 cases from X-ray images. By leveraging deep learning and CNN models, the system has the potential to assist in early diagnosis and timely intervention, contributing to effective management and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

# COVID19 Detection App
Covid19 Detection Streamlit App based on Deep Learning

This project focuses on developing a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to detect COVID-19 cases from X-ray images accurately. By leveraging CNNs, the model aims to assist medical professionals in diagnosing COVID-19 based on radiographic imaging effectively.

The project follows these key steps:

1. Data Collection: Gather a diverse and labeled dataset containing X-ray images of COVID-19 positive cases as well as non-COVID-19 cases (normal or other types of pneumonia).

2. Data Preprocessing: Apply essential preprocessing steps like resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare the X-ray images for training the CNN model effectively.

3. Model Architecture: Design a CNN model architecture tailored specifically for COVID-19 detection. Experiment with various architectures like VGG, ResNet, or custom designs to find the optimal model.

4. Model Training: Split the dataset into training and validation sets. Train the CNN model using the training set and optimize its parameters through an algorithm like gradient descent. Validate the model's performance on the validation set and fine-tune hyperparameters to enhance accuracy.

5. Model Evaluation: Assess the trained CNN model using a separate test set that was not used during training. Evaluate key metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to determine the model's effectiveness in COVID-19 detection.

6. Deployment and User Interface: Develop a user-friendly interface, utilizing web frameworks like Streamlit or Flask, to enable users to upload X-ray images for COVID-19 detection. The interface should display prediction results (COVID-19 positive or negative) and associated probabilities.

7. Fine-tuning and Improvement: Continuously refine the model by incorporating user feedback and additional data. Enhance the model's accuracy and generalization through architectural adjustments, hyperparameter tuning, and even leveraging transfer learning techniques.

By creating an accurate COVID-19 detection system based on X-ray images, this project aims to provide valuable support to healthcare professionals in promptly identifying COVID-19 cases. This can contribute to early diagnosis, timely intervention, and effective management of the disease.
